# Cram: Command-Line Functional Test Framework

[![Shippable](https://img.shields.io/shippable/5701519833e2f1203f8ca8d0.svg?maxAge=86400)](https://app.shippable.com/projects/5701519833e2f1203f8ca8d0)

This is a Go port of the [Cram][] command-line test framework. Cram
makes it easy to test command-line programs by recording commands with
their expected output.

## Status

This project is still under development and should probably not be
used in a production setting.

> **The project is a learning tool for me to become familiar with the
> Go language**. I would therefore prefer to experiment and implement
> the basic functionality myself. However, feel free to report bugs
> for any issues you might find. Thanks! *â€”Martin Geisler*

## Documentation

Please take a look at [the Cram test suite][tests]. The tests there
serve as documentation as well as a regression test suite.
